        ⭐ Anti-anti-adblock - we prevent websites from detecting ad blocking software.
        ⭐ Faster page load - by preventing adnetworks to send you ads, we make the site much faster to load.
        
        ✓ Permissions: like common ad-blocking extensions we do need default permissions on every website to remove ads or popups
